[semu](https://github.com/sysprog21/semu) is a minimalist RISC-V system emulator capable of running Linux the kernel and corresponding userland. semu implements the following:

* RISC-V instruction set architecture: RV32IMA
* Privilege levels: S and U modes
* Control and status registers (CSR)
* Virtual memory system: RV32 MMU
* UART: 8250/16550
* PLIC (platform-level interrupt controller): 32 interrupts, no priority
* Standard SBI, with the timer extension

My contributions include the virtualization of several hardware components:
* **VirtIO Block:** Emulates block storage devices, allowing the guest OS to mount and access disk images
* **VirtIO GPU:** Emulates a graphics device supporting [X11](https://www.x.org/wiki/), [Mesa3D](https://mesa3d.org/), [DirectFB](https://directfb2.github.io/), etc.
* **VirtIO Input:** Emulates input devices such as mouse and keyboard for interactive use
* **VirtIO Entropy:** Emulates a random number generator (RNG), supplying entropy required by many software components to operate correctly (e.g., system libraries, cryptographic routines, networking tools)
