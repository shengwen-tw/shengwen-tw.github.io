Before this role, I was a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I later chose to transition into industry to gain professional experience while remaining involved in academic activities.","Outside of my role at NVIDIA, I specialize in robotics, embedded systems, real-time operating systems (RTOS), and hardware-software integration. I hold a master’s degree in Robotics from [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index), where I conducted research in the [Networked Control Robotics Lab (NCRL)](https://en.ncrl.lab.nycu.edu.tw/) under the supervision of [Dr. Teng-Hu Cheng](https://me.nycu.edu.tw/en/people/teacher/Teng-Hu-Cheng-18641258). My work focused on developing a quadrotor flight control system using nonlinear control and sensor fusion algorithms. This system was later licensed to the [Taiwan Space Agency (TASA)](https://www.tasa.org.tw/en-US) for scientific research purposes.","I am also an active contributor to open-source projects and have presented my work at international conferences, including top-tier venues such as the [Embedded Open Source Summit (EOSS)](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/embedded-open-source-summit/). My technical experience includes the design and implementation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), RTOS, and virtual machines."],"avatar":"profile.png","professions":["Software Engineer","Robotics Engineer"],"tocMaxDepth":2,"excerptMaxLength":500,"birthday":"Aug 12, 1997","location":"Taiwan","email":"shengwen.c@utexas.edu","postsForArchivePage":3,"social":[{"url":"/resume.pdf","icon":["ai","cv"]},{"url":"https://github.com/shengwen-tw","icon":["fab","github"]},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shengwen-tw/","icon":["fab","linkedin"]},{"url":"https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=RCZ5dUgAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW","icon":["fab","google-scholar"]}],"disqusScript":"","contactFormUrl":"https://getform.io/f/09a3066f-c638-40db-ad59-05e4ed71e451","pages":{"home":"/","posts":"posts","contact":"contact","resume":"resume","tags":"tags","research":"research"},"wakatime":{"username":"","activity":"","language":"","editor":"","os":""},"interests":[{"icon":["fas","fa-code"],"title":"Robotics, Control, and Estimation"},{"icon":["fas","layer-group"],"title":"Machine Learning"},{"icon":["fas","fa-microchip"],"title":"Embedded/Real-time Systems"},{"icon":["fab","linux"],"title":"Open Source Software"}],"education":[{"date":"Sept 2022 - Mar 2024","icon":["fas","university"],"title":"Ph.D. Student in Electrical Engineering","location":"National Taiwan University, Taiwan"},{"date":"Sep 2019 - Nov 2021","icon":["fas","university"],"title":"M.S. in Robotics","location":"National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"},{"date":"Sep 2015 - June 2019","icon":["fas","university"],"title":"B.E. in Computer Science and Information Engineering","location":"Providence University, Taiwan"}],"experience":[{"title":"Conference Papers","position":"left","data":[{"date":"","title":"S.-W.
