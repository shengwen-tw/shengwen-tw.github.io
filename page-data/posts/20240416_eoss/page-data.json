I presented a project I’ve been working on related to UAV system integration. EOSS was held alongside the Open Source Summit North America (OSSNA) and the Linux Security Summit North America (LSSNA), offering a great chance to learn from great developers in the open source community.\n\nBeyond the conference itself, we also took time to visit UC Berkeley, the University of Washington, and Microsoft's headquarters.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aXPNn7SbN5oBkVzIqHo13JiRVv_63CJi/preview\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\"></iframe>\n\n## Scenes from the event\n\nSeattle Convention Center entrance:\n\n![434655317_696406069164267_8151621621815969253_n](./SksEK_NWA.jpg)\n\nKeynote room:\n\n![435326422_7343903255723082_2404586767770416717_n](./BJDBt_E-0.jpg)\n\nA talk on Linux network driver development:\n\n![435144565_731149022555914_7358343535456862563_n](./S1xvq_EWC.jpg)\n\nExhibition hall featuring the latest tech:\n\n![435073927_1375954223116885_3856083484791949013_n](./B1BUKdEbR.jpg)\n\nEvening banquet:\n\n![435277390_277977581948113_8498689988933146104_n](./rkfLK_V-A.jpg)\n\n## UC Berkeley \n\nOn our way to Seattle, we had a long layover in San Francisco, so we took the chance to visit UC Berkeley. It's a place I’ve always wanted to visit because of its strong open source and hacker culture. It’s also the birthplace of the BSD operating system.\n\nCoincidentally, the day we visited was **Cal Day**, Berkeley’s annual open campus event, which made the experience even more special.\n\n![434607866_953786796204705_7350614652183572978_n](./BJdHU_N-C.jpg)\n\nSather Gate:\n\n![439557636_1581947312638164_8371646204801684612_n](./HkWLLOVW0.jpg)\n\nSather Tower:\n\n![435375744_958751538789271_3737858726084342054_n](./r1d88dVZR.jpg)\n\nView from the top of the tower:\n\n![434655317_696406069164267_8151621621815969253_n (1)](./ByGz2_EWC.jpg)\n\nCal Day band performance:\n\n![435025794_967307381627701_8030032678594614014_n](./BJhL8ONZC.jpg)\n\nStudent orientation in the auditorium:\n\n![435174619_765086202046253_8047207169571958591_n](./Hk6cvOE-R.jpg)\n\n## University of Washington\n\nWe visited the University of Washington during a break in the summit. Since it’s close to Microsoft’s HQ, both Bill Gates and Paul Allen have donated buildings to the university. We were shown around by a few student friends, short but memorable.\n\n![435313518_449077920843574_1193868091891110933_n](./SyghW_NbC.jpg)\n\nSuzzallo Library exterior:\n\n![435010955_1432593210951355_1200405360207344007_n](./Hk9sZO4ZC.jpg)\n\nInside Suzzallo Library:\n\n![435030604_467910858905864_1544103927905222785_n](./Hy3sZONWR.jpg)\n\nStained glass windows:\n\n![435226453_445650437932949_2499296796948849510_n](./ry0s-dEZA.jpg)\n\nBill & Melinda Gates Center:\n\n![439575746_1195952504903597_8089535962621884157_n](./ryeXh-_EZA.jpg)\n\nElectrical & Computer Engineering Building (donated by Paul Allen):\n\n![434525145_788320573360186_5697745618314009011_n](./B1_sZ_EZ0.jpg)\n\n## Microsoft HQ\n\nA friend working at Microsoft kindly gave us a tour of the campuses in Redmond and Bellevue, which together include over 100 buildings. It’s a vast and impressive place.\n\nDue to restrictions, we couldn’t take photos inside workspaces, but we did capture public areas like Building 92 (the Visitor Center), lounges, and some historical exhibits.\n\n![1](./r11G1_VbR.jpg)\n\nBuilding 92 - Visitor Center:\n\n![434641197_448346957652221_8444356631318564609_n (1)](./HkyZ4_Eb0.jpg)\n\nStaff lounge and relaxation areas:\n\n![1](./HyYFkdEZC.jpg)\n\n![439282613_450842170844452_6370501303934702273_n (1)](./BJXWVOEW0.jpg)\n\nSome classic items displayed in the Microsoft visiting center:\n\n![435219083_835669248585667_4168929279265008793_n](./HJOQ7_NbA.jpg)\n\n![434581033_1124622328786780_4692623872900193909_n](./rk_7X_4-A.jpg)\n\n![435115554_417004171029561_6900576729952275177_n](./Hkx_X7uEZA.jpg)\n","htmlEncrypted":"","nonce":"","timeToRead":null,"title":"Embedded Open Source Summit 2024","date":"1713225600000","tags":["conference"],"path":"posts/20240416_eoss","excerpt":"","links":[],"commit":0,"type":"posts"}},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/shengwen-tw.github.io/shengwen-tw.github.io/example/content/posts/20240416_eoss/index.mdx"}}},"pageContext":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/shengwen-tw.github.io/shengwen-tw.github.io/example/content/posts/20240416_eoss/index.mdx","postPath":"posts/20240416_eoss","translations":[{"hreflang":"en","path":"/posts/20240416_eoss"}],"frontmatter":{"title":"Embedded Open Source Summit 2024","tags":["conference"],"date":"2024-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","cover":"./HyhBY_EWA.jpg","path":"posts/20240416_eoss"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1552981879","2158328490","2612084189"],"slicesMap":{}}
